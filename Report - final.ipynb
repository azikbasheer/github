This will allow us to see where we should open up a restaurant, as we would like to open one in a heavily populated area. We would also like the income to be high in this area, so consumers will be willing to dine frequently at the restaurant.

However, it is also important to note that several other locations either had high income or population but not both, and they should also be considered but will not be as beneficial.
